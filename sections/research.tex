My research focuses on \textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} and \textbf{Information Retrieval (IR)}, specializing in the analysis, understanding, and generation of natural language, as well as extracting information from document collections.
I concentrate on applications involving \textbf{scholarly documents}, leveraging generative AI to assist researchers in critical tasks such as literature search, paper understanding and scientific writing.
